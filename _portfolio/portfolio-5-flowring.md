Microgestures offer an excellent solution for on-the-go scenarios, enabling discreet and subtle input in motion-rich environments. In contrast, immersive experiences like desktop require high-precision continuous pointing and selection. As lightweight AR (North Focals, Oppo Air Glass 2) and productivity-oriented VR (Meta Quest Pro, Apple Vision Pro) slowly converge, future devices may require both interaction paradigms. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlowRing, a novel ring wearable that supports both in-air gestures (four cardinal direction swipes and taps) and precise on-surface 2D continuous interactions using an optical flow sensor, skin-contact microphone, and IMU. In a user study involving 13 participants, FlowRing achieved a gesture recognition accuracy of 92.7% across sessions and an accuracy of 84.0% across users, rising to 93.0% with four gesture examples. A separate study involving a 2D Fitts law test demonstrated the system's effectiveness for continuous input tasks. This paper comprehensively describes the FlowRing device, its sensing capabilities, the evaluation studies, and the exciting possibilities it opens up for future interaction scenarios.

# Motivation
FlowRing enables both quick, discreet in-air microgestures (left) and precise on-surface interactions (right), allowing for always-available, ad-hoc interactions. Such a peripheral could control wearable devices quickly like changing earbud volume while on-the-go or be used to control an immersive desktop environment in a mixed reality headset.

# Contributions
* We develop FlowRing, a wireless ring device with optical flow, a contact microphone, and an IMU that enablesboth on-the-go subtle input and in-situ expressive input.
* We build a hardware and software pipeline to collect, evaluate, and validate interaction data.
* A 13-person user study demonstrating the effectiveness of FlowRing’s microgesture input capabilities acrossusers with different hand sizes and skin tones and a Fitts’ evaluation of continuous 2D surface interaction.
