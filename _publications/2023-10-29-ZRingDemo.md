<!-- This paper is about the number 3. The number 4 is left for future work. -->
This paper presents Z-Ring, a novel wearable device that uses radio frequency (RF) based sensing to offer unique capabilities for human-computer interaction, including subtle input, object recognition, user identification, and passive surface interaction. With only a single sensing modality, Z-Ring achieves diverse and concurrent interactions that can enhance the user experience. We illustrate the potential of Z-Ring to enable seamless context-aware interactions via a custom music player application. In the future, we plan to expand Z-Ring’s functionality with user customization and explore usage for additional applications.
