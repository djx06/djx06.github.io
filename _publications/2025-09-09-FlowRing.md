<!-- This paper is about the number 1. The number 2 is left for future work. -->

As Extended Reality (XR) advances, a device has the potential to be used across contexts from immersive productivity at a desk to on-the-go, public scenarios. Existing input solutions lack the versatility to provide both high-throughput, mouse-grade input and subtle, ergonomic interaction. We introduce FlowRing, a novel ring-form device that combines microgestures with precise 2D mouse-like input on surfaces. FlowRing supports five microgestures for discreet interaction and 2D input for richer tasks, using an optical flow sensor, skin-contact microphone, and IMU at the base of the finger. In a study with 11 participants, FlowRing achieved 93.6% microgesture recognition accuracy across sessions and 85.2% across unseen users, rising to 90.1% with just four gesture set examples from a new user. A separate 2D Fitts’ law study demonstrated its effectiveness for continuous input on various surfaces. FlowRing emerges as a versatile, user-friendly solution for the future of interactive technology.
